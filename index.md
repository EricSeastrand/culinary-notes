# Things I wish I knew when I started

## Heat and temperature
  * ### Why do we need heat in the first place?
    * #### Browning
      * Sauteeing vegetables for carmelization
      * Searing
        * Maillard reaction on meats
        * Oil the food, not the pan
        * There will be smoke. Open a window.
      * browning on nonstick: it doesn't happen
    * #### Sanitary reasons
      * Internal temperature vs Surface temperature
      * Instant kill temps vs Holding lower temp longer
      * Vetetables
        * Bacteria not a major concern, but some need cooking for other reasons:  https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/vegetables-shouldnt-eat-raw-11414.html
      * Meats
        * Fish: parasites, bacteria, and botulism
        * Chicken: Salmonella
        * Beef: The dangerous stuff on the outside
        * Pork: FDA recommended temps outdated because that bacteria isn't an issue in farm raised
      * Killing microbes won't remove toxic byproducts they made (botulism)
  * ### Heat generation devices/use-cases
    * Instant pot
      * Sauteeing in it
      * Single pot meals -- minimal cleanup
      * Mashed potatoes!
      * Sous Vide
    * Ricecooker
      * Steam veggies while cooking rice
    * Crockpot/slowcooker
      * Use a bag for sticky stuff like queso
    * The microwave!
      * Low-and-slow is the key to re-heating food
      * Add a little water to rice. Leave it on high: rice can take a beating. Works on potatoes, carrots.
      * Good for pre-boiling water to expedite rice cooker or instantpot cooking
    * The oven
      * Pre-heating : the thermostat lies
      * Low and slow steak like Good Eats
    * The electric stove
      * Latency: turning up/down and actual temp change
  * ### Heat delivery devices/use-cases
    * Cast iron skillet
    * Stainless Steel fry pan / skillet
    * Non-stick fry pan
  * ### Heat conduction compounds
    * Water
    * Ghee (butter minus milk protein)
    * Butter
    * Avocado Oil
    * Canola Oil
    * Olive Oil: don't do it
  * ### Measuring devices
    * Instant read infared
    * Probe
    * Oven thermometer
    * Leave in meat probe
